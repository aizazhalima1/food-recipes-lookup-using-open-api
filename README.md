## About the Project
You can find food recipe by typing the name as input. In response, you get the recipe along with a youtube video guide for the same. An api has been used to get the data.</br>

## How It's Made:
**Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API** </br>
A website that makes use of an open api to get information such as the name of the recipe, cooking instructions as well as the youtube video guide. Flexbox has been used to achieve responsiveness in the layout.
The main purpose of developing this website is to demonstrate the implementation of the API as per the documentation guide.


## Optimizations
The recipes are limited to 100. Some that can be searched through succesfully are:
Pasta, 
Pizza,
Noodles,
...

## Lessons Learnt:
While retrieving the video, the link provided in the API documentation guide did not work. I figured that the link needed to be modified by adding the embed in the link for the video to be displayed.
